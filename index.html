      <h1>You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.</h1>
      <p>Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?</p>
      <p>What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is! ' My precious torso! No argument here. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. <strong> Bender!</strong> <em> Ship!</em> Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!</p>
      <h2>So, how 'bout them Knicks?</h2>
      <p>That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</p>
      <ol>
      <li>No argument here.</li><li>Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.</li><li>Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</li>

      <h3>Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</h3>
      <p>And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Take me to your leader! Hello, little man. I will destroy you! I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Oh God, what have I done?</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?</li><li>Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.</li><li>No, I'm Santa Claus!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Kif might! Shut up and take my money!</p>
      <p>No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! I don't want to be rescued. I love you, buddy! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!</p>
      <p>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Do a flip! And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?</p>
      <p>Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</p>
      <p>Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Actually, that's still true. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!</p>
      <p>Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Why did you bring us here? Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. No argument here. Shut up and get to the point!</p>
      <p>We're rescuing ya. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!</p>
      <p>Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!</p>
      <p>No! Don't jump! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</p>
      <p>Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Hey, whatcha watching? Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.</p>
      <p>For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.</p>
